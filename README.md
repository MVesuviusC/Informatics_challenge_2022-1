# Matt Cannon's 2022 Bioinformatics Challenge
#### Author : Ali Snedden

## Purpose:
This repo contains my solutions to Matt Cannon's 2022 Bioinformatics Challenge.
I am submitting my solutions as an ADVANCED user.

## Solutions :
My solutions are contained in both `answers.Rmd`, `images/`, `src/`

1. `answers.Rmd` : contains the questions with answers. Can be compiled (see below )
2. `images/`      : contains the plots / images requested by some of the problems
3. `src/`        : contains the source code for solutions where the answer is too long to include in `answers.Rmd`


## Installation and Dependencies :
This repo was tested with 

1. R/4.0
2. Python/3.6
3. Pandoc


## Compiling :
To compile the pdf of my answers in answers.Rmd: 

```
pandoc -f markdown answers.Rmd -o answers.pdf
```

The pdf will be ugly with respect to line wrapping
