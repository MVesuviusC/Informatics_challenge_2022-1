# Beginner questions - 1 point per question

## --R-specific-- Data and variable types

1. Make a numeric vector at least three elements long
    a) Answer :

    ```{r}
    > a <- c(0,1,2)
    > is.vector(a)
    [1] TRUE
    ```

2. Make a named list object where the values are 10, 15, 20 and 25 and the
nams of the elements are "Billy", "Eli", "Ali" and "Jordan"

3. Make a data frame where one column is random foods and the second column is
mad-up calorie values

4. Add a new column of some sort to the data frame you made in question 3 and
assgn the output a new variable

5. Remove the column you just added and assign this to a new variable

## Make basic plots

You can access a test dataset in R using the following code:

```{r}
mtcars <- mtcars
```

If you want to use a language other than R, the data can be downloaded here: https://nationwidechildrens-my.sharepoint.com/:t:/g/personal/matthew_cannon_nationwidechildrens_org/EbYpZRiuizFOjd9nz4vKn38Br8z2hEKnRijltqbzsUgnow?e=pPnNxW

6. Using the mtcars data, make a scatterplot of displacement (disp) vs mpg

7. Using the mtcars data again, make a boxplot of hp separated by cyl

8. Using the mtcars data again, make a barplot of displacement (disp) for each
engine shape (column "vs")

## Do a t-test

9. What is the *p*-value for a *t*-test (using the mtcars data), that tests if
displacement (disp) varies between engine shapes (column "vs")?

## Basic unix commands

10. Which command is used to create a new directory?

11. Which command shows the size of a file?

12. Which command lets you delete a file?

13. Which command copies a file?

14. Which command moves a file from one directory to another?

## Basic stats knowledge

15. Does a *t*-test assume that the measurements follow a normal distribution?

16. Briefly (1-2 sentences), what is the difference between parametric and
non-parametric tests?

17. Name one method to perform multiple testing correction

18. For a set of statistical tests, using a FDR cutoff of 0.1 will, in theory,
result in what percentage of false positives in your "significant" tests?

## Basic file/data formats

19.  What file/data format is this?

```{verbatim, max.height='100px'}
>Sequence_1
AGTACATGGGGAGCTGGCGCAATGACGACCTAATTGGCGCACAGTACTAGGCATCGTCATCCAATGCGACGAGTCCTAC

```{verbatim, max.height='100px'}
@A00498:77:HGHFVDRXX:1:2101:3775:1016 1:N:0:NACGGCTC

21. What file/data format is this?

```{}
chr1  213941196  213942363
chr1  213942363  213943530
chr1  213943530  213944697
chr2  158364697  158365864
chr2  158365864  158367031
chr3  127477031  127478198
```

22. What are the two main differences between a bam and sam file?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Intermediate - 2 points per question

## Make fancy plots

23. Using the mtcars data, make a plot of mpg vs disp, coloring the points by
cyl. Include a title. Be sure the colors used are color-blind friendly.

24. From the previous plot, include a legend for point colors and make the
title of the legend "Cylinder".

25. Add a linear regression line to the plot along with text in the plot 
providing the Pearson's correlation and the *p*-value

## Align reads to a reference

26. On the Franklin cluster, in the folder /gpfs0/scratch/mvc002/ are two files:

  -   infoChallenge_R1.fastq.gz
  -   infoChallenge_R2.fastq.gz
  
  Align these reads to the hg38 reference using your aligner of choice and share
  your code.
  Several pre-made references are available here:
  `/reference/homo_sapiens/hg38/ucsc_assembly/illumina_download/Sequence/`.

27. Share a screenshot of some of the aligned reads in IGV

28. Is this dataset whole genome sequencing, RNAseq, ChIPseq or amplicon seq?

## --R-specific-- Demonstrate the use of pipes and tidyverse functions

29. In R, starting with the mtcars dataset use `filter()` to remove any row
where cyl is "8" and then use `group_by()` to group the data by gear and then
use `summarize()` to calculate the average of the mpg column per group. This
should be in one continuous pipeline without intermediate variables or nested
functions. Use either pipe (`%>%` or `|>`).

## Write a bash loop

30. Write a "for loop" in bash to loop over the numbers 1-10 and print them to
the console

## Git and GitHub

31. For your submission, put your results up into a public GitHub repository
and provide the link

32. Make sure your repo includes at least two branches and two commits

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Hard - 3 points per question

## Harder plotting

33. Add histograms to the top and right side of the mtcars mpg vs disp
scatterplot so that it looks like Figure 1. Note that the axes of each plot
should align.

## Get sequences from SRA

34. Using the command line, download the SRR10197556 dataset from the NCBI SRA
repository

## Bash variable expansion

35. Create a variable in bash containing the text "path/to/target/file.txt" and
then share code to trim off the path ("path/to/target/")

36. Create a variable in bash containing the text "path/to/target/file.txt" and
then share code to trim off the file extension (".txt")

## Grep

37. Use the Unix grep function to match the pattern "GATACA" in `/gpfs0/scratch/mvc002/infoChallenge_1.fastq.gz` on the Franklin cluster. How
many lines had a match?

## Write a program

38. Share code written in a language other than R or bash that reads in a fastq
file and trims 10 characters from the 3' end of the read and quality score
fields. You can use the `/gpfs0/scratch/mvc002/infoChallenge_1.fastq.gz` file to
test your code. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Too hard - 4 points per question

## Finding a sequence in a fasta file?

39. How many times does sequence "GATTACA" appear in this fasta file? `/reference/homo_sapiens/hg38/ucsc_assembly/illumina_download/Sequence/WholeGenomeFasta/genome.fa`

## Using awk

40. Use this gtf file (`/reference/homo_sapiens/hg38/ucsc_assembly/illumina_download/Annotation/Genes/genes.gtf`)
and the Unix `awk` command to keep only the lines where first column is "chr11"
and the fourth column is greater than 100,000. How many lines are in the output?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# I hate myself - 5 point per question

## Identify the mystery data type

41. On the Franklin cluster is a folder /gpfs0/scratch/mvc002/. Inside this
folder are two files:
  -   mysteryData_R1.fastq.gz
  -   mysteryData_R2.fastq.gz
  What kind of sequencing experiment are these data derived from?

42. What species do these reads come from?

## Harder programming

43. Share code that finds a specified sequence in a fasta file, which also
allows for ambiguous bases in the query
